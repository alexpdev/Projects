Project name is a `scralenium` that allows _use selenium webdriver with scrapy_ to do scrape web data from dynamic web pages.  The name is actually really clever, if you didn't notice it is `scrapy` + `selenium` = `scralenium`.  Genius right? :)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

-   You have installed the latest version of `python 3`
-   You are familiar with the scrapy framework

Requirements:

-   scrapy
-   selenium

## Installing

To install `scralenium`, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexpdev/scralenium.git
cd scralenium
pip install .
```

From PyPi

```bash
pip install scralenium
```

## License

This project uses the following license: [Apache 2.0](./LICENSE).

## Usage

Using `scralenium` is really simple.

In your scrappy settings set the `SELENIUM_DRIVER_NAME` and  
`SELENIUM_DRIVER_EXECUTABLE` fields.  `scralenium` currently supports
firfox, chrome, and remote as values in the SELENIUM_DRIVER_NAME field. If  
the webdriver executable is already on `path` then it can be omitted. You 
also need to enable the `ScraleniumDownloaderMiddleware` in the 
`DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES` feed.

```python
from shutil import which

SELENIUM_DRIVER_EXECUTABLE = which("chromedriver")
SELENIUM_DRIVER_NAME = "chrome"

DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES {
    "scralenium.ScraleniumDownloaderMiddleware" : 950
}
```

Once you have added the settings to the `settings.py` file or in the 
spider's `custom_settings` attribute all that is needed is to use 
`ScraleniumRequest` when yielding from the `start_requests` method or
from your parse callback methods. The `pause` argument can be used to set
the webdrivers implicit wait value.  And the `response` argument in the 
parse callback methods gives you full access to the normal scrapy response 
as well as all the features of the webdriver.

```python
from scralenium import ScraleniumRequest
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

class MySpider(scrapy.Spider):

    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            ScreleniumRequest(url, callback=self.parse, pause=4)
    
    def parse(self, response):
        html = response.text
        title = response.xpath("//title/text()").get()
        element = response.find_element(By.ID, "submit-button")
        element.send_keys(Keys.Return)
        next_page = response.xpath("//a[@class='next-page-link']/@href").get()
        next_url = response.urljoin(next_page)
        yield ScraleniumRequest(next_url, callback=self.parse, pause=4)
        yield {"title": title}
```

I am have added some additional features but am behind on documenting them.

## TODO

[x] add features
\[] document them
